# Scan For Files of a Specific Title or Extension in the Directory and/or Subdirectories

This script will scan through directories and subdirectories for a particular file extension and save it to an excel file

# Future Updates (WIP)

This code can be further optimised. For future updates I will:
 - Add the option to save to different file formats;
 - Add the option to include a short summary of the file scanned.
